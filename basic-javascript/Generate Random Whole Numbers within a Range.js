// Create a function called randomRange that takes a range myMin and myMax and returns a random whole number that's greater than or equal to myMin, and is less than or equal to myMax, inclusive.

function randomRange(myMin, myMax) {
  // Only change code below this line
  return 0;
  // Only change code above this line
}

/* output
The lowest random number that can be generated by randomRange should be equal to your minimum number, myMin.

The highest random number that can be generated by randomRange should be equal to your maximum number, myMax.

The random number generated by randomRange should be an integer, not a decimal.

randomRange should use both myMax and myMin, and return a random number in your range. */
